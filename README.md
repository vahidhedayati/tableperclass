The problem now shows itself:

http://localhost:8080/test/test1 

This should print all ohho we have.. but instead the first has updated correctly and the othe 2 refreshes on println shows correct information but actual page refrsh or relisting shows old ahh results

```
[ahha Tue Jul 25 18:48:10 BST 2017 - 2017-07-25 18:48:10.632, ahha Tue Jul 25 18:48:12 BST 2017 - 2017-07-25 18:48:12.629, ohho we have a new name Tue Jul 25 18:48:16 BST 2017 - Tue Jul 25 18:48:16 BST 2017]
```
